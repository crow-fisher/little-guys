Soil model

Track particle size by: 
> Percent sand, silt, clay
> Impacts to water drainage and how nutrients flow through it

Model "basic" nutrients: 
> Potassium, Phosphorus, others. These are getting aggregated into one.
> This will be carried by water, and removed when plants are harvested

Model nitrogen:
> Allow for nitrogen fixing
> Nitrogen fixing will be relatively "automaatic"
  > E.g., legumes are nitrogen fixing with the correct application of rhizobia
  > but in the game, they'll "just work"

Model ph 
> Plants will need to be in specific bands of ph. 
> Will allow for plants to have different colors based on ph (eg, hydrangeas)

Basically, 





-- Impact to plants: 

NITROGEN

Low: 
> Lower leaves yellow, higher leaves become pale
> Poorly developed shoots or branches
> Decrease in flowering / fruits 
> Slow growth rate

High:
> Abnormally dark
> Overly succulent shoots and leaves


POTASSIUM

Low:
> Tend to wilt more
> Smaller development



The size of sand particles range between 2.0 and 0.05 mm; silt, 0.05 mm and 0.002 mm; and clay, less than 0.002 mm. 

Primary nutrients: 



** Nitrogen

Track carbon-nitrogen ratio
When the C:N ratio of decomposing organic residues is between 20:1 and 30:1, mineralization and immobilization occur at fairly equal rates.
Net mineralization occurs at C:N ratios less than 20:1.
Net immobilization occurs at C:N ratios greater than above 30:1.
Most well decomposed organic matter in soils have a C:N ration near 10:1
