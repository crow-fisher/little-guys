little guys is a game about building diverse and complex ecosytems, where every plant has its own niche and role.

plants grow to optimize for the nutrients they need, which they use to grow new plant parts and to reproduce.

various inorganic blocks are included with various properties. broadly, dirt is the most nutrient-dense, sand is less nutrient dense, and gravel does not provide nutrients and cannot be grown into by plants.

current ecosystems:
* wetland:
  * moss
  * water lillies
  * pop grass
* other:
  * cactus
